# spotiscord

Back in the dark days of 2017, Discord didn't have Spotify integration and you couldn't share what you were listening to with your friends live. This bot was a very simple script that fixed that function. It takes your Spotify user token, and uses your Discord user token as the Discord 'bot', and then your game status to display what you were listening to. 

## Requirements
discord.js
spotify-web-helper

I have no guarantees that these still work but given the simplicity of the program I can't imagine that it will be that difficult to fix if thats the case.
